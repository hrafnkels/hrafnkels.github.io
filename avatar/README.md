Tech
-------------

Flat Design Character Maker uses a number of open source projects to work properly:

* [JQWidgets](http://www.jqwidgets.com/jquery-widgets-demo/demos/jqxsplitter/index.htm#demos/jqxsplitter/nested-splitters.htm) - Resizable columns
* [JQuery Mini Colors](https://labs.abeautifulsite.net/jquery-minicolors/) - Color picker
* [jQuery](http://jquery.com/) - Because the first two libraries abve require it
* [saveSvgAsPng](https://github.com/exupero/saveSvgAsPng) - Saves our SVG as a PNG
* [FileSaver.js](https://github.com/eligrey/FileSaver.js/) - Easy way to save files
* [SweetAlert2](https://sweetalert2.github.io/) - Stylish alert dialog
* [TinyColor](https://github.com/bgrins/TinyColor) - Converts color codes
* [Moveit](https://github.com/Raminsiach/Moveit) - SVG Path Animator

Design
-------------
* Currently all the characters were designed by [Michael Schwartz](http://michaelsboost.github.io/) using [Gravit Designer](https://designer.io/).

To-Do

Development
-------------

Want to contribute? Great!  

I posted a video on YouTube showing you exactly how you can add a feature design (like front-hair, facial hair, eyes, body-types, etc:) to the application.

You can watch that video here - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zpcx4210IE

I recommend designing the character in Gravit Designer because the code it outputs is cleaner and easier to manage than any other vector editor I've used. 

**NOTE**: You will not be able to change the fill color if fill is specified as a style attribute, but only as a fill html attribute.
